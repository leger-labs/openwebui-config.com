## Previous notes on the Sequential Implementation Plan for Schema-Driven Development
```
Here's a step-by-step sequence to implement your schema-driven development approach. Each phase builds on the previous one, allowing you to make steady progress while maintaining a clear direction:
Phase 1: Design System Extraction and Definition

Complete comprehensive analysis of Vercel's configuration UI, documenting all patterns and components
Categorize identified components by function (toggles, conditional fields, form groups, etc.)
Map Vercel patterns to equivalent shadcn components and identify extension requirements
Create a component design specification document that formalizes your findings
Implement base shadcn-extended components with proper styling and behavior

Phase 2: Schema Enhancement and Standardization

Audit current OpenWebUI schema to identify missing metadata and inconsistencies
Define formal extension schema for UI metadata (x-ui, x-category, x-depends-on, etc.)
Enhance OpenAPI schema with complete UI metadata for all configuration variables
Group configuration variables into logical feature sets based on functionality
Add implementation metadata to track development status in the schema

Phase 3: Code Generation Tools Development

Create OpenAPI-to-Zod schema generator that handles conditional validation
Implement React component generator that produces shadcn-based forms with React Hook Form
Build documentation stub generator based on schema definitions
Develop GitHub issue creator that transforms schema changes into tracked work items
Create backend validation/service scaffold generator from schema definitions

Phase 4: Workflow Automation Setup

Set up GitHub Action to detect schema changes and trigger processing
Implement diff analysis to identify what changed between schema versions
Create schema validator to ensure all additions follow your metadata standards
Develop reporting tool to visualize implementation status across the configuration system
Set up PR templating and automatic linking to generated issues

Phase 5: Iterative Implementation and Refinement

Select initial feature group to test complete workflow
Implement frontend, backend, and documentation for the test feature
Gather feedback and refine automation tools based on real usage
Expand to remaining feature groups in priority order
Establish continuous improvement process for both tools and workflow

This sequential approach ensures that you build the foundation (understanding patterns and enhancing your schema) before moving to automation and implementation. Each phase delivers concrete value while setting up for the next phase.
The workflow becomes increasingly automated as you progress, ultimately creating a system where schema changes automatically generate the appropriate issues, code scaffolding, and documentationâ€”significantly accelerating your development process for the hundreds of configuration variables in your system.
